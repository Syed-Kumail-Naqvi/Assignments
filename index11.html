                <p>Bringing up your child with proper attention to their oral health is a lifelong
                investment in their health, which will benefit them greatly for the rest of their lives.
                <strong>Early childhood cavities is a disease that can ruin your child’s teeth, even into
                adulthood, but it is easily preventable.</strong></p>
                <p>There are a wide variety of steps you can take to teach your child good dental habits,
                and one of the best is leading by example. Make sure your child knows how much importance
                you place on dental health so they know that it is something to be valued. Brushing your
                teeth along with your child and letting them follow your lead can be really helpful in
                setting up the habit of teeth brushing in your child’s life.</p>

            <h3>How do I care for my childs primary teeth?</h3>
            <p>Even though your childs baby teeth fall out eventually, it is important to take good care
            of them while they are present. Baby teeth are important for biting, chewing, and serve as
            guides to adult teeth which will eventually grow in. Taking proper care of baby teeth is
            essential for maintaining overall oral health.</p> <hr />
